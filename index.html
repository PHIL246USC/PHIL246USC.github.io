# PHIL246: Foundations of Cognitive Science 



### .red[4] Language (.red[Day 1])

???

GIF credit: www.sergebloch.com



???

In the module on concepts, we spent a good amount of time talking about what concepts in a cognitive science are for, and what properties they have. We suggested, following Fodor, that the computational-representational theory of mind does a good job of guaranteeing that we have entities that do the right kinds of things. 

We presumed, there, that there is a tight relationship between WORDS and CONCEPTS, and between SENTENCES and THOUGHTS. CONCEPTS are the meanings of words, we said, and THOUGHTS are the meanings of sentences. 

Now, we can talk about language. Once we do, we find a couple of interesting tensions: 
1- between whether language is FOR communication, or FOR thought 
2- between whether language is WHOLLY modular, vs crucially implicated in CENTRAL SYSTEM processing, 
Etc.

# Agenda: .red[Module 4]

0. .red[What is (human) language?]

  - Introduction
  - Who communicates, and how?
  - Properties of human language

1. What is it for? 

2. How is it acquired?

3. What good is language? 

???

In this module, we'll begin by warming you up to certain elementary questions and observations about human language, emphasizing its cognitive aspects to the necessary exclusion of its communicative aspects. 

We'll talk about what it's for, how it's acquired, and what it's good for. 

We'll dwell, in the end, on an intriguing possibility that is being explored more and more in the contemporary literature: that language, at the appropriate level of abstract, JUST IS the vehicle for domain-general thought.

# Introduction

???

Let's begin with an introduction by way of a series of questions. 

First,

# What is .red[a] language? 

.footnote[https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/how-many-languages-are-there-world]

---
# What is .red[a] language? 

“a dialect with an army and a navy” (att. to M. Weinreich)


.footnote[https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/how-many-languages-are-there-world]

???

“What counts as a language rather than a ‘mere’ dialect typically involves issues of statehood, economics, literary traditions and writing systems, and other trappings of power, authority and culture — with purely linguistic considerations playing a less significant role.” 

---
# What is .red[a] language? 

“a dialect with an army and a navy” (att. to M. Weinreich)

* “Chinese” glosses over Mandarin, Cantonese, Hakka, Shanghainese, which are as different from each other as French, Spanish, Italian, and Romanian are
Hindi (India) and Urdu (Pakistan) are essentially the same system; at least, they are less different than Mandarin is from Cantonese

* with the break-up of Yugoslavia, the language formerly known as Serbo-Croatian was replaced with at least three new ones (Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian), though the linguistic facts didn’t change


.footnote[https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/how-many-languages-are-there-world]

???

“For instance, Chinese “dialects” such as Cantonese, Hakka, Shanghainese, etc. are just as different from one another (and from the dominant Mandarin) as Romance languages such as French, Spanish, Italian and Romanian. They are not mutually intelligible, but their status derives from their association with a single nation and a shared writing system, as well as from explicit government policy.

In contrast, Hindi and Urdu are essentially the same system (referred to in earlier times as “Hindustani”), but associated with different countries (India and Pakistan), different writing systems, and different religious orientations. Although varieties in use in India and Pakistan by well-educated speakers are somewhat more distinct than the local vernaculars, the differences are still minimal—far less significant than those separating Mandarin from Cantonese, for example.
For an extreme example of this phenomenon, consider the language formerly known as Serbo-Croatian, spoken over much of the territory of the former Yugoslavia and generally considered a single language with different local dialects and writing systems. Within this territory, Serbs (who are largely Orthodox) use a Cyrillic alphabet, while Croats (largely Roman Catholic) use the Latin alphabet. Within a period of only a few years after the breakup of Yugoslavia as a political entity, at least three new languages (Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian) had emerged, although the actual linguistic facts had not changed a bit.

# .red[How many] are there? 

"English" is (only) a useful fiction

- Does *sorry* rhyme with *story* or with *Ferrari*?

- Is *I'm done my homework!* grammatical, or not? 

- Is *Bruce be running marathons* grammatical, or not? 

---
# .red[How many] are there? 

linguists often cite as the only “scientifically respectable” answers...

1. There is **one** language—*human* (cf. Chomsky and the Martian scientist)

2. There are as many as there are people—**approx 7.53 billion**

### not "close to human" smarts

.pull-right[.image-100[![](images/nyt-nim chimpsky.png)]]

<blockquote>
Nim Chimpsky, adopted into a human environment when he was 3 months old, learned a number of different signs that he used to communicate with his human handlers—some estimates put it as high as 125. But even his staunchest advocate — Herbert Terrace, a psychology professor at Colombia — ultimately concluded that Nim's linguistic abilities were exceeded even by three year old human children.

# Mean Length of Utterance (MLU)

One way of measuring language development is to analyze the number of morphemes they produce (i.e., minimal meaning-bearing units; e.g., *went* has two, GO and PAST), divided by number of utterances.

      MLU  =  Total number of morphemes
              -------------------------
              Total number of utterances

A child's MLU typically corresponds closely to their age. Roger Brown (1973) described 5 stages of language development based on this measure. 

     stage    MLU        approx. age (mos.)   
       I      1.0-2.0        12-26            
       II     2.0-2.5        27-30            
       III    2.5-3.0        31-34            
       IV     3.0-3.75       35-40            
       V      3.75-4.5       41-46            
       V+     4.5+           47+              

???

What Terrace has in mind are data like this. Nim seemed not to have excelled past stage II.

Year equivalents: 

   1-2

   2 - 2 1/2

   2 1/2 - 3

   3 - 3 1/2

   3 1/2 - 4

   4+

  Much of the grammatical knowledge displayed by a 20 year old is already in place by 4 years old for typically-developing children, regardless of wide variation in the social, cultural, geographical, and linguistic features of the child’s environment.

# Human language is special 

???

But, let's start at the beginning. What is so special about human language? 

In this module, we will explore the idea that what is special about it is its unique COGNITIVE effects, rather than its unique COMMUNICATIVE potential. 

This section aims to get at the ways in which we can OBSERVATIONALLY see that human language is rather unique in its particular combination of properties. Later, we will want to figure out the significance of these observations.

# Who .red[communicates], and how?

.red[Humans] can communicate in all sorts of ways:

   - Verbal/sign language
   - Written language
   - Body "language"
   - Facial expression
   - Emoji
   - Text message
   - Etc.

... We can ask some very simple questions to try and get at WHAT is special about verbal/sign language.

# "SNAKE!"

.image-80[![Big snake](images/Black-Snake-White-Background-Images.jpg)]

???

The very FIRST thing we can observe about this ability is that if you see something, like a gigantic snake, you can SAY something informative about what you see—you can communicate, for example, that there's a snake.

What might you do if you heard someone shout SNAKE in a room like this?

This aspect of our language isn't very different. 

These monkeys ppear to be COMMUNICATING: if one sounds an alarm of a particular sort, the rest react appropriate to the danger being signaled.

### "There's a snake two feet away from you on your left side!" 

.image-80[![Big snake](images/Black-Snake-White-Background-Images.jpg)]

???

One thing that seems to differentiate human language from what the vervet monkeys are doing, is the level of SPECIFICITY to our speech. We don't just have the word "snake", we can say something about exactly where the snake is, for example.

But lest we think that this ability is unique in PRINCIPLE, consider the honeybees' "waggle" dance.

# *Tanzsprache* ('Dance language').red[*]

.image-90[![Bee dances](images/vonFrisch.GIF)]

.footnote[.red[*] http://www.animalbehavioronline.com/frisch.html ]

???

There is much more to the bee's dance that this clip doesn't tell you about.

There are actually two dances, and the bee can choose one depending on th edistance of the food source (up to 50 meters is the circle dance, Figure A). The vigorousness of the "straight run" part of the waggle dance (Figure B) signals the RICHNESS of the food source, and so on. 

What questions might you have about this ability that the bee has?

Example: How is it acquired? Did the bee LEARN to do this dance? 

See also: 
- Prairie dogs (size, shape, speed, and type of predator; with humans, apparently even something about how they're dressed!)
- Dolphins - whistles to indicate their name, age, gender

See (to begin with) the ethologist and Nobel laureate Karl von Frisch's (Austrian biologist) famous work on the bee dance.

Here's a slightly more precise way of putting the question we're exploring right now:

... So, let us get a feel for the COMBINATION of properties that appear to distinguish human language.

# Yes, human language is .red[special] 

It has four properties, which .red[in combination] are unique in the animal kingdom: 

1. Discreteness

2. Grammar

3. Productivity

4. Displacement

???

I'm going to explicate each of these points in turn.

# Yes, human language is .red[special] 

It has four properties, which .red[in combination] are unique in the animal kingdom: 

1. Discreteness - intuitively .red[the same] *b* and *t* in *bat* and *tab*, *anti* in *antichrist* and *antithesis*, &amp;c 

2. Grammar - these units combine by .red[rule]; such a hypothesis captures what is intuitively possible (*cat-[s]*) and not possible (*cat-[ez]*)

3. Productivity - the rules produce .red[an unbounded number of new expressions] out of more basic ones 

4. Displacement - we can .red[talk about things very far] from our present experience, both in space and time, and about what's merely possible

???

Phonology governs how we TALK, not how we spell. Phonological rules are learned when we're a kid, and no teacher taught us how to talk. 

What evidence do we have for internalized rules? The WUG test.

The "wug test" was first used by Jean Berko Gleason to illustrate that children really have internalized morphological rules. Read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Berko_Gleason

In fact, often what makes foreign languages SOUND foreign is that they're attempting to produce English sentences using a very different phonological system---they haven't mastered these implicit rules perfectly.

.footnote[.red[*] From Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky". ]

???

We don't store sentences whole, and then "look them up" when we need them. We actively assign meaning to novel sentences. And much of what makes grammar truly meaningful are the bits that we aren't used to thinking about. For instance, we can get meaning even in what is ultimately nonsense.

Obviously, if you haven't read Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and *Through the Looking Glass*, you should do so immediately.
